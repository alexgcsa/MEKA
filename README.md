# MEKA

Source code of the modified MEKA (version 1.4.1) framework for the Automated Multi-Label Classification (Auto-MLC) project. The original code is available at meka.sourceforge.net/ and https://github.com/Waikato/meka/.

Main differences to the original version:

1) How the statistics are generated to the user. Now, the statistics contain the measures for the train set and the test set.

2) Modifications in the classifier's output, to make easy to handle and get the classification measures produced by the MLC algorithm.

3) Issue presented at: https://github.com/Waikato/meka/issues/42#issuecomment-317722567
